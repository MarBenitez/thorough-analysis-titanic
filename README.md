# Project Structure:

- [titanic_st_github.py](https://github.com/MarBenitez/thorough-analysis-titanic/blob/main/titanic_st_github.py): Streamlit application for interactive data exploration, visualization and explanation.
- [titanic_st_presentation.py](https://github.com/MarBenitez/thorough-analysis-titanic/blob/main/titanic_st_presentation.py): Streamlit application for interactive data exploration and visualization.
- [titanic_eda.ipynb](https://github.com/MarBenitez/thorough-analysis-titanic/blob/main/titanic_eda.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook for initial data exploration and analysis.
- [titanic.csv](https://github.com/MarBenitez/thorough-analysis-titanic/blob/main/titanic.csv): Contains the Titanic dataset (CSV format).

  This [__Streamlit__](https://thorough-analysis-titanic-eda.streamlit.app/) application provides a user-friendly interface for analyzing the Titanic data. Key functionalities include:
  
  * Data loading and visualization.
  * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
  * Interactive visualizations using Plotly or other libraries.
  * Additional insights and findings.

  This Jupyter Notebook serves as a starting point for exploratory data analysis. It might include:
  
  * Importing libraries and loading the dataset.
  * Data cleaning and preprocessing.
  * Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques (descriptive statistics, visualizations).
  * Feature engineering.
